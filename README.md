# BeeColonyOptimisation

Authors: Lina Lazik, Sönke Lülf, Hendrik Schmidt

This is a grou project I was involved in for the course Nature Inspired Algorithms.
For this course our group had to develop a task for the other students to solve. The focus of the task was the implementation of th BeeColony Optimisation algorithm.

We chose the distributon of hospitals in Osnabrück as the problems to be optimised. The other students were provided with a map of Osnabrück and a distribution of houses. They then had to implement the Bee Colony Optimisation algorithm to decide how to best distribute hospitals in the city.

This repository hold both the task as well as our sample solution.
